# Spark MLlib and Spark ML demo scripts

This is a collection of scripts that will enable you to play around with Spark MLlib and ML on your computer. 
The examples should work out of the box once you are finished with the installation steps. 

If you have any comments or questions, drop me a line at zoltanctoth@gmail.com.

## Getting started


Here is an intro Prezi for this repo:

  1. Data for MLLib is generated by the `generate_random_data.py` script.
  2. It is visualized by the `show-data.R` script.
  3. Logistic Regression for both MLlib and Spark.ML are demod in `Logistic Regression Example.ipynb`
  4. You can find a working SparkR example in `SparkR Logistic Regression Example.r`
